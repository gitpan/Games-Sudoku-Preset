PURPOSE
-------
This document informs about Games::Sudoku::Preset version 0.01.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Games::Sudoku::Preset is a graphical tool to enter, edit and validate
the preset values of a classical 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. It has 3 start
methods for these purposes:

    use Games::Sudoku::Preset;

    # Enter the preset values for a new Sudoku puzzle
    my $puzzle = Games::Sudoku::Preset->enter();

    # Edit an existing Sudoku puzzle
    my $puzzle = Games::Sudoku::Preset->edit($game);

    # Validate an existing Sudoku puzzle
    my $puzzle = Games::Sudoku::Preset->validate($game);

Validation
----------
Validation means that the current preset values are checked
whether they violate the well known basic rules for a
Sudoku puzzle (e. g. have twice the same digit in a row).
When an error is found, the affected cells are marked in red
on the displayed Sudoku board.

Validation occurs when a Sudoku puzzle is passed to a start
method. The current puzzle on the graphical board is validated
again when the user presses the "Done" button to return the
puzzle to the caller. The module doesn't return if an error
is found. The user may store an unvalidated puzzle for later
continuation by using the "Save & Cancel" button.

Editing
-------
Editing of the values on the graphical Sudoku board may be 
done intuitively and comfortably via the mouse or via the keyboard.
